      <p>
        I'm Jillian — a 22-year-old creative driven by a deep love for human connection and the meaningful communication that bridges people to each other and to their purpose. My background in communication and media studies shaped the way I think about stories, systems, and how we relate. Whether I'm behind a camera capturing light and texture, building out a brand's online presence, or designing something that just <em>feels</em> right — it's all rooted in the desire to connect.

      <p>
        I’m drawn to photography, videography, and the way visual aesthetics can shift how we feel and how we move through digital space. That curiosity has pulled me into web design, graphic storytelling, and the everyday artistry of building brands that feel authentic. I'm still exploring all the ways my creativity can show up — and that’s part of what I love most.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the screen, I learn from the people and communities around me. I love helping small businesses step into their digital voice, clarify their aesthetic, and connect with their audience in a way that resonates. I believe beauty and clarity make room for trust — and I want to help more people and brands communicate their worth with integrity and intention.
